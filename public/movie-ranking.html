<h2>My Top Three Movies Of All Time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The pursuit of happiness</h3>
<p> this is my one of the favourite movie,The Pursuit of Happyness is a film based on the life of the tycoon Christopher Gardner. This film demonstrates the battles that Chris Gardner faces while attempting to make a good life for himself and his child. The main themes of this film which i loved the most and learned a lot from is perseverance, determination, and never giving up on your dreams. </p>
<h3>Wall Street</h3>
<p>The movie that gave the world Michael Douglas’ Gordon Gekko and the mantra ‘Greed is good’ functions best as a cautionary tale for anyone stepping into the world of finance.
Naive Bud Fox idolizes Gekko and his glamorous lifestyle but is eventually caught up in a tangled web of insider trading.Young entrepreneurs can be easily lured by greed, and sometimes make immoral decisions. Wall Street serves as a reminder of what can happen if you go down an unethical path</p>
<h3>12Th fAIL</h3>
<p>Manoj Kumar Sharma belongs to Chambal village where cheating in exam is a common thing. He is appearing for his 12th standard exams and eyeing a peon's job.
